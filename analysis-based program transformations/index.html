Materials on Analysis-Based Program Transformations</h1>

<p>This page is for materials related to my lecture in <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7480-s17" >CS 7480
History of Programming Languages</a>, February, 2017</p>

<ul>
  <li>My slides, in <a href="Slides.pptx" >ppt</a> and <a
  href="Slides.pdf" >pdf</a>. 
  </li>

  <li><a href="page615.pdf" >Example of old-fashioned flow
  equations</a> (from Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman, Compilers:
  Principles, Techniques, and Tools (2nd Edition), 2006).  </li>

    <li><a href="shivers-pldi-91.pdf" >Olin Shivers paper</a> from 1991,
  showing the state of the art at the time.  From Olin I learned the
  key idea of deriving control flow and data flow at the same time.
  </li>

  <li><a href="My Questions - Spring 91.pdf" >My notebook page from
  Spring 1991</a>, showing what I was worrying about at the time.
  This is a page from a notepad at a DARPA meeting; my memory is that
  I wrote it at lunch to show to Paul Hudak.</li>

  <li>My <a href="Notes on Control Flow Analysis 1992 02 10.pdf"
  >notes</a> from what appears to be a pl-seminar presentation in
  January 1992. </li>

  <li><a href=" Wand-Steckler-popl-94.pdf" >Selective and Lightweight
  Closure Conversion</a>, with Paul Steckler.  This is our first paper
  on CFA and program transformation.  This version is from POPL '94,
  the first of several versions of the paper; it eventually appeared
  in TOPLAS '97.  There's a lot more stuff in this paper than I will
  discuss in class: we were trying to get towards polymorphic analysis
  and also to get "ordinary" and closure-converted procedures to
  interoperate. </li>

  <li><a href=" Wand-Clinger-iccl-98.pdf" >Set Constraints for Destructive Array Update Optimization</a>, with
  Will Clinger.  This version is from the IEEE Conference on Computer
  Languages in 1998, a conference that existed only from 1988 to
  1998. The <a href=" wand-clinger-jfp-01.pdf" >journal version</a>
  appeared in JFP in 1991, with detailed proofs.  Christos Dimoulas
  obtained a <a href="Dimoulas-Wand-vmcai-09.pdf" >more general
  result</a>, including higher-order functions and arrays with non-scalar
  values, which appeared in VMCAI 2009</li>
  
</ul>

<p>Here are a couple of papers that we are unlikely to get to in
class, but which you may find of interest.</p>

<ul>


    <li><a href="Wand-Siveroni-popl-99.pdf" >Constraint Systems for
  Useless Variable Elimination</a>, with Igor Siveroni (POPL 1999),
  used the same techniques to transform a program by not passing
  values that were known dead.  Again, this provided proofs for
  techniques that were discussed in Olin's dissertation.  </li>

  <li><a href="Palsberg-Wand-jfp-03.pdf" >CPS Transformation of Flow
  Information</a>, with Jens Palsberg (JFP 2003), considered the
  question of how a CPS transformation changes the flow information of
  a program.  This turned out to be a more subtle question than we
  realized, since it depends on both what you mean by a CPS
  translation and what you mean by 0CFA. </li>

</ul>
