## Title: Type-directed Compilation, Part I
### Speaker: Leif Andersen

Today is the story of how 2 worlds came together:

1. World of compiler hackers, C and Fortran programmers, "types go fast" people
2. World of type theorists, polymorphism and parametricity, "more types = faster"

> "more types therefore faster" was an unsubstantiated claim until 1992


### _Unboxed Objects and Polymorphic Typing_, Xavier Leroy, POPL 1992

target language: OCaml (ML light)
problem: the compiler used boxed data
goal: use the type system to implement an "unboxing" compiler pass;
      instead of representing an integer as a pointer to a machine number,
      just use the machine number (need to be careful with floats ---
      they require 2 words of space)

> M: why do we care about this?

> X: cache hits

> L: paper claims even the constant-factor lookup is a problem


### _Compiling Polymorphism Using Intensional Type Analysis_, Robert Harper and Greg Morrisett, POPL 1995

> why are they breaking their tongues calling it "intensional type analysis"?
> because the proper word is _ad-hoc polymorphism_, but everyone knows ad-hoc
> polymorphism is "types at runtime" is BAD. It's marketing.

> J: why not use templates?

> S: templates don't have a clear / clean design

> L: templates make too much code

> M: templates work by **recompiling** code. There's no separate compilation!


Leroy's 1992 paper had a mistake in the proof (related to effects).

> A: what's the bug?

> M: his transformation is moving / shifting side effects

> M: Harper's insight was that _let polymorphism_ is a bad idea, Hindley-Milner
>    was already buggy in the same sense.

> R: LP wihout value restriction

Key idea (fixed proof) is to compile `Λ` to `λτ` and everything works.
But this requires types at runtime.

> M: you should all read Cardelli's _Typeful Programming_
>    also don't forget the Bruce Duba metatheorem, that your calculus needs at
>    least 2 effects otherwise there is no hope it will scale to a real language


### _TIL: A Type-Directed Optimizing Compiler for ML_, David Tarditi and Greg Morrisett and Perry Cheng and Chris Stone and Robert Harper and Peter Lee, PLDI 1996

nice contrast to previous paper, keep types for a long time in the compiler,
but erase for runtime

relation between source-language and intermediate-language types,
add environments after each pass to preserve/check the relation

> A: are source/target related by a **relation** or a **function** ?

> ?: relation would be unsound

> R: does TIL have optional optimizations?


### _From System F to Typed Assembly Language_, Greg Morrisett and David Walker and Karl Crary and Neal Glew, POPL 1998

Two rules of TAL:

- do not read uninitialized memory
- do not allocate memory you do not own

> M: these rule out standard Fortran optimizations, e.g. the fast way to
>    create an array with millions of cells


> ?: this is not assembly, this is fake C without function pointers

> D: it's assembly with a garbage collector

> ?: Reynolds suggested TAL to Peter Lee and Bob Harper

meta theorem: for all X, Reynolds thought of X years ago
